# E-commerce DQLAB Project

## Project at DQLab
In this project, I will demonstrate an end-to-end data analysis project for an superstore company. The data used in this project is from an superstore platform, and the user is a Business Analyst who wants to gain insights into the company's sales performance and customer behavior.

## Business Request & Demand Overview
In every data analytics/business inteliigence project, there must be a business request and demand overview from the user who will take advantage of the result/output. The user request for this project can be seen as below:

## Database ER Diagram
The database has become a fact table, so it doesn't have an ERD from which the data is taken can be seen below:

## Data Cleansing & Transformation
Because the database is still so simple, we don't need too complicated queries to get the required data. Below is the SQL query for the data:
